* static semantic
* unit tests for each grammar rule
* GC
* opt<type> and 'null'
* init the parser with the string

* default methods: 
    equals 
    to_string 
    hash
    deepcopy 
    fill_property_values - this one is like a copy constructor

* package semantic: std.natives.some_class is a full name of a class
    std.natives.some_class.func1 -> is a full name of a function of this class
    std.natives.some_class.func2 -> ...

*[V] gen cast expression
* string concatenation
* const variables in generated file!
* annotations (method, field, class, etc)
*[V+-] cast expression types compatibility

*[V] maybe add some compile-time macros like __FILE__, __LINE__, are they useful? 
    I think that they are.
    we do not have a preprocessor, so it's quite easy to implement these macros.
    just change the type of parsed token at lexer stage, that's it.
  
* destructors for tests methods

* modifiers -> all variables are final by-default, we need a mut modifier
    and then - apply this to code-generator, it will help the
    compiler optimize the result code.

*[V] add string methods (left, right, etc)
*[V] fix string constructor code generation [new string("a.b.c")]

* error codes, and pretty error printing, equal for every situation.
  | file:line
  | error [code]: [message]
  | to_string
  
  Here's a thing: we must keep our AST.toString() clean during the parse state.
  It must print its real representation.
  Without any c-code semantic (like types, pointers, etc.)
  And we have to manage a different ToString class, when we build a low-level code.
  So: we use toString() in classes only during the parse stage.
  And then - we implement our own toString() for each type, class, method, etc.

*[V] add predefined buffer with native classes: [string, array, opt, fd, fmt]

* generic functions in static classes.

* builtin 'hash' function. 
    We cannot use a class-method like we do with 'equals' method,
    because we also need this function
    for primitives, and we use primitives in containers, and we do
    not have wrappers like in java int/Integer, etc.


* destructors for recursive structs.
	It is quite important to not ruine the stack.
	Because it will invoke themself as many times as it possible.
	Read CPP std, and think about it.

*[V] null terminator in a strings and in a char array.

* a real position of the allocated object.
  we have to use this position for handle errors if the malloc fails for some reson or other.

*[V] an array have to be an embed class.




///07.01.2022 ::

1) Rewrite interface's FlatCodeItems. 
For every implementor interface must have a constructor:
	markable_init_for_token(mstruct markable *__this, void *object) {
		__this->object = object;
		__this->mark = &token_mark;
		...
	}
	markable_init_for_literal(mstruct markable *__this, void *object) {
		__this->object = object;
		__this->mark = &literal_mark;
		...
	}

2)[V] Remove IntrinsicText. Not a good idea, you cannot optimize this.

3)[V] Add BuiltinAssertTrue item.

4) Implement the 'str' as a builtin class. 
	Clean the code-generation properly.
	1 - 'str' class must initialize itself using 'char arr[]' labels.
	2 - All of the methods from 'str' move to 'strbuf'(mutable string).
	3 - Remove all static arrays and strings structs, a LOT of space.
	
5)[V] Rename and clean all of the items in IR.

6) Try to realize: how to change the expression during the annotation
stage - whether the field access is a static field access, method-call
is a static method call, etc... ExprIdent is a static ExprIdent...
