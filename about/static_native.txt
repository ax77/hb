The main difference between static and native classes is:
  1) we may create a native class by using 'new' expression
  2) we cannot instantiate a static class
  3) static class has no constructors/destructors/default methods
  4) we do not generate c-structs for static classes
  5) we DO generate c-structs for native classes, and we must know exactly what we do
